# Why
- After implementing  these following repos:
  - Neural Network from scratch using only Numpy: https://github.com/SrEntropy/numpy-nn-from-scratch
  - Neural Network from scratch using pyTorch Tensors: https://github.com/SrEntropy/pytorch-tensors-from-scratch
  
   
# Backpropagation
A deep dive into backpropagation to build a small autograd to gain a better understanding of multivariable derivatives, the chain rule, and minimizing the loss.
